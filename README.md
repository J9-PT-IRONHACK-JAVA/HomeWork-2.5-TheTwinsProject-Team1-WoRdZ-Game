*** WoRdZ Game ***
==========

A console game to recreate Buenafuente’s game. 

It uses the DataMuse API, which provides different word-related queries…

… Among them, a full list of statistically related words, which we use to approximate the idea of the original Words. 


<h2> RULES: </h2>

There are 2 game modes:

- ARCADE: A word is presented (random generated, under Animals category), and the player has to guess a related word.
- MANUAL: The player can type their own word, and (themselves or a friend) guess a related word.

Beware: The relationship is conceptual, but must not be too obvious! 

- There are 5 rounds in each game.
- You have 3 attempts per word.
- Each correct answer adds 1 point.

The goal is to guess as many rounds as possible, to be at the top of the HALL OF FAME

Goodluck!
